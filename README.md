# Dev Profile

[Dev Profile](https://lighthearted-profiterole-52f79b.netlify.app/) is a job task I received from [SystemOnSilocon](https://www.systemonsilicon.com/). The task requirements are to develop a web app with reg, login, and profile page. I completed the task within 12-14 hours. You can visit the live site [here](https://lighthearted-profiterole-52f79b.netlify.app/).

## Features and functionalities:

- Single page fully responsive web app. You can use this app on any device.
- Users will have a great experience using this app. If an action(creating a profile, login, profile update, etc.) becomes successful or fails, the user will be notified via a toast.
- The user's profile is a private route. So a user cannot go there without login in.

## How to navigate through the repo: 

First, you need to clone or download the zip file of this repo. Then you will find two folders on it: 

**task_client:** You can find the client-side source code created with create-react-app. So you need to install all the dependencies and run the *npm start* command to start the local host server.

**task_server:** You can find all the server-side RESTful APIs source code created with Express.js.

## Used tools and technologies: 

### Client Side

- create-react-app
- Tailwind CSS
- daisyUi
- React hook form 
- React lottie
- React router dom
- React hot toast

### Server side
